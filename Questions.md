Arrays and Lists:
What is an array, and how is it different from a list?
 - an array is an enumeration of objects and is mutable compared to a list which is unmutable.
What is the time complexity of accessing an element in an array?
- an array is accessed by its index, oreder in the enumeration whereas a list object is accessed by a key
How do you initialize an array in Python?
- []
How does dynamic resizing work in a list in Python (e.g., when appending elements)?
- the array occupies more memory than it initially needs and as elements are appended, the memory is occupied
How is memory managed for arrays vs lists in Python?
- arrays reserve more memory than they actually need compared to lists that occupy exactly the amount of memory they need
What are the pros and cons of using arrays compared to lists?
 - arrays pros ()
